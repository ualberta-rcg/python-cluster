title: Setup
---

It is hoped that you have already taken an introductory to shell, introduction to HPC and an
introductory Python course and have connected to a cluster via SSH previously. The Research Computing
Group at the University of Alberta periodically provide the following prerequisite courses (based off of
content from the Carpentries):

* <https://ualberta-rcg.github.io/hpc-intro/>
* <https://ualberta-rcg.github.io/hpc-intro/>
* <https://ualberta-rcg.github.io/python-intro/>

The instructor will have instructions for logging into the cluster during the workshop
(they will supply the hostname, the username and password that you need).

The connection to the cluster will be via SSH, so it is important that you have an SSH client running
on your computer before the workshop. For many systems (Mac and Linux), that's often as simple as opening
a terminal and typing:

```
ssh username@hostname
```

On Windows 10 and later, you can open a command prompt (`cmd`) and type the above.

On Windows there are also applications like `MobaXTerm` and `git-bash` that provide the functionality
to connect to a cluster via SSH.
