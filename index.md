Are you ready to move your Python code to an HPC cluster?

This hands-on workshop (3 hours) will give students an insight into running Python code on high performance computing clusters. Includes setting up jobs for batch submission, loading dependant Python packages, and interactive use on the cluster. Students should have some experience with the shell (e.g., HPC Shell Basics workshop), experience submitting jobs (e.g., HPC Essentials workshop), and at least one introductory Python course.
