You may have learned to program Python through Jupyter notebooks, which provides an
excellent playground for learning Python.

We will now look at running Python code on high performance computing (HPC) clusters, which
involves learning some new techniques for running Python code, often outside of Jupyter
notebooks.

The expectations of the students is that they have previously taken:

* an introduction to bash shell;
* an introduction to running jobs;
* an introduction to the Python programming library.

Today we'll look at:

* Virtual environments and installing packages;
* Submitting jobs that run Python code;
* Storage choices and the impact on performance;
* Interactive jobs;
* Connecting to HPC JupyterHubs.

At this point, your instructor should have given you access to a training cluster,
and you should now be logged in.
