You may have learned to program Python through Jupyter notebooks, which provides an
excellent playground for learning Python.

We will now look at running Python code on high performance computing (HPC) clusters, which
involves learning some new techniques for running Python code, often outside of Jupyter
notebooks.

We'll look at:

* Virtual environments and installing packages;
* Submitting jobs that run Python code;
* Connecting to HPC JupyterHubs;
* (?) Choices for parallelism.
